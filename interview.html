                <div class="question-answer">
                    <p class="question">Can you tell us a bit about your background and what led you to specialize in mental health?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Absolutely. I've always been passionate about understanding the human mind and helping people navigate their mental health challenges.

                    <p class="question">What are some common mental health issues you're seeing today?</p>
                    <p class="answer">In recent years, I've noticed a significant increase in anxiety and depression, particularly among young adults. The pressures of modern life, social media influence, and the recent global events have contributed to heightened stress levels. It's important to address these issues with compassion and provide effective coping strategies.</p>

                    <p class="question">What practical steps can individuals take to improve their mental health daily?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Self-care is crucial. Simple practices like maintaining a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and prioritizing sleep can make a big difference.

                    <p class="answer">Certainly. One effective strategy is grounding exercises, which help bring your focus to the present moment. Techniques like the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise, where you identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste, can be very helpful. Additionally, talking to a trusted friend or therapist can provide valuable support.</p>

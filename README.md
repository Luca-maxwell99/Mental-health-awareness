# Mental Health Awareness

Welcome to my Mental Health Awareness website. The mission of this webapge is to provide resources, support, and information to help individuals understand and improve their mental health. Included are various related topics, a call to action, a form and a professional interview. I choose to do these things as it covers diffrent point of views of mental health  with the intension of helping a wide range of audiences. 

I opted for a relatviely easy going website with nice colours and a simple UX. Allowing web users to navigate seamlessly. 

## why 

Thank you for visiting our website and supporting mental health awareness.

I didnt allow my self enough time at all to finish this project. Its a good learning curve.
